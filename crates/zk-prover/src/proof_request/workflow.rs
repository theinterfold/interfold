//! Deterministic proof-request workflow dispatch and completion.
//!
//! The [`crate::actors::proof_request::ProofRequestActor`] is a thin transport
//! shell: it owns the event bus and signer and performs all publish/sign I/O.
//! This module owns the business logic — the per-E3 pending-proof state machines
//! (which proofs have arrived, when a set is complete) and the deterministic
//! dispatch *planning* (which proof requests to emit, in what order, with which
//! `seq` index). It has NO actix / `BusHandle` / signing concerns.
